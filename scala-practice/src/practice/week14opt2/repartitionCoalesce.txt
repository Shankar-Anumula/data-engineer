Repartition and coalesce
=====================================
For reducing partitions - coalesce is better option

	1. Demo on repartition vs coalesce when we ant to decrease the number of partitions
		a. When we are using coalesce then the resultant partitions can be of unequal sizes..
		b. When we are using repartition then full shuffling is involved which is time consuming but we know that the resultant partition is of similar size
	
Repartition
======================
	
val rdd1 = sc.textFile("bigLog1.txt")
rdd1.getNumPartitions
val rdd2 = rdd1.repartition(6)
rdd2.count

Repartition always goes through full shuffle

coalesce
========================

val rdd1 = sc.textFile("bigLog1.txt")
rdd1.getNumPartitions
val rdd2 = rdd1.coalesce(6)
rdd2.count

No shuffling involved so single stage and processing is faster
